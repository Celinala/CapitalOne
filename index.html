  <h2 id="n7">Downtown/Civic Center</h2>
  <p>As the heart of the city, Downtown/Union Square is a never-ending stream of sights, sounds, smells, and places to shop (frugal wallets beware!). This neighborhood is known for 24-hour activity, whether you’re sipping early morning cappuccinos at a sidewalk cafe or on your third round of late-night drinks at a high-roller’s lounge.</p>
    <p>Home to San Francisco’s City Hall and surrounded by equally important-looking buildings, Civic Center is the city’s main site for culturally significant activity. Flanked by an opera house, a library, a museum, and two plazas, this esteemed-seeming neighborhood is known to become seedy after sunset.</p>

  <h2 id="n13">Inner Richmond</h2>

    </article>

<article>
  <h2 id="n14">Inner Sunset</h2>
    <p>Besides the Inner Sunset’s rolling fog, there’s nothing bleak about this funky neighborhood. Bordering Golden Gate Park and home to University of California, San Francisco campus, the Inner Sunset remains close to nature without losing its big-city edge.</p>

   <p></p>
   </article>

<article>
  <h2 id="n16">Marina</h2>
    <p>A dreamy neighborhood on the edge of the bay, the Marina entices shoppers, diners, and picnickers to crowd its boutique-lined streets and hilly green space. Offering unmatched views of the Golden Gate Bridge and front row seats to witness water’s ferocity, this high-end haunt can be a bit intimidating.</p>
    </article>

<article>
  <h2 id="n17">Mission</h2>
  <p>The Mission District's multifarious corridors comprise an invitingly seedy melting pot of cultures, cuisines, and cool kids. Dusty produce bins line the sidewalks in front of colorful Latino markets, and the aroma of fresh roasted coffee beans emanates from first-class cafes along this diverse neighborhood’s main streets. </p>
 <p>Mission Terrace approaches San Francisco’s outskirts, but this friendly community shares the same intimate vibe of its more central neighbors.</p>
  </article>

<article>
  <h2 id="n18">Nob Valley</h2>
   <p>With prices as high as its hilltops, immaculately maintained streets and storefronts lend Nob Hill an exclusive air. Historic Victorian homes and spectacular views add to the neighborhood’s unattainable mystique, while a Gothic style cathedral contributes to its old-world opulence. </p>
 </article>

<article>
  <h2 id="n19">Noe Valley</h2>
   <p>As a delightfully sunny neighborhood in the midst of a city so often shrouded in fog, Noe Valley attracts a laid-back crowd looking to score fresh vegetables at its farmer’s market or sip on a full-bodied glass of red wine.</p>
   </article>

<article>
  <h2 id="n20">North Beach</h2>
    <p>North Beach is an Italian-centric, crowd-pleasing neighborhood where picnicking and people watching are highly regarded pastimes. This noisy neighborhood is dotted with a motley mix of cute cafes serving perfect espresso, independent bookshops celebrating the Beatnik era, and sultry nightclubs whose performances are not intended for young audiences.</p>
  </article>

  <h2 id="n21">Ocean view</h2>
    <p></p>
  </article>

<article>
  <h2 id="n22">Outer Mission</h2>
    <p>Colorful homes replete with blooming gardens line Mission Terrace’s surprisingly sunny streets, and local markets and pizza parlors are more common than strip malls and national chains.</p>
    </article>

<article>
  <h2 id="n23">Outer Richmond</h2>
    <p>Bordering Golden Gate Park to the south and the Presidio to the north, the Richmond District is an under-the-radar residential neighborhood surrounded by green space. Although it’s not the height of hipness, it’s important to note that the Richmond is not uncool. </p>
    </article>

<article>
  <h2 id="n24">Outer Sunset</h2>
    <p>Salty ocean air and ever-present fog blanket the Sunset District. Undaunted by dampness, rows of modest stucco homes share the Outer Sunset’s mostly quiet streets with locally beloved produce co-ops, casual restaurants, and cheeky cafes.</p>
  </article>

<article>
  <h2 id="n25">Pacific Heights</h2>

  </article>

<article>
  <h2 id="n28">Presidio</h2>

    </article>

<article>
  <h2 id="n30">Russian Hill</h2>
    <p>Perched along San Francisco’s highest hilltops and among its most crooked streets (Lombard Street sure is squiggly!), Russian Hill is an intimate neighborhood more likely to host wine tours than bar crawls. This charming area channels a San Francisco from the past—sidewalks are replaced by hidden stairways and residents ride the city’s iconic cable cars. Cozy cafes and local-favorite watering holes round out this reserved neighborhood’s cordial repertoire.</p>

  <h2 id="n34">Twin Peaks</h2>

  </article>

<article>
  <h2 id="n35">Visitacion Valley</h2>
    <p>Visitacion Valley’s on-the-edges location lends the neighborhood an air of insularity. It may soon shed its “locals only” reputation, as Visitacion Valley's residents are focused on community efforts aimed at improving their neighborhood. </p>
    </article>

<article>
  <h2 id="n36">West of Twin Peaks</h2>
    <p></p>
    </article>

<article>
  <h2 id="n37">Western Addition</h2>
    <p>Having survived San Francisco’s 1906 earthquake and ensuing fires, Western Addition/NOPA's Victorian homes are some of the oldest in the city. Its historic ties extend beyond its architecture—this conveniently located neighborhood was once the epicenter of the city’s jazz scene.</p>
